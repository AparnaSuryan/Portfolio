# 2015 US Airline Performance Analysis (Power BI)

Analyzing flight operations, delays, and cancellations across US airlines using interactive Power BI dashboards.

## Overview

This project investigates the performance of US airlines in 2015 using Power BI visualizations. The analysis focuses on total flights, cancellations, delays, distances, and airport-level insights to help understand airline efficiency and customer experience.

## Key Skills & Tools

- Power BI: Slicers, cards, bar charts, pie charts, scatterplots, treemaps
- Data Analysis: Performance metrics interpretation, visual storytelling, comparative analysis
- Insights Generation: Identifying trends, peak days, and operational efficiency

## Visualizations & Insights

1. Card Visualization

- *Shows total flights, average departure delays, canceled flights, max/min distance, and maximum flights*
- *Southwest Airlines Co had the highest number of flights, while Delta Airlines flew the longest distances*
- *Virgin America had the shortest routes and fewest cancellations*

***Insight: Helps identify major airlines per airport and long-distance operators***

2. Pie Chart for Cancellations

- *Visualizes percentage of canceled flights per airline*
- *Southwest Airlines had the highest percentage of cancellations, Virgin America the lowest*

***Insight: Cancellations alone are insufficient to measure airline performance without considering total flights***

3. Bar Chart for Total Flights

- *Compares number of flights per airline*
- *SkyWest Airlines operated the most flights; Spirit Airlines had highest average departure delays despite fewer flights*

***Insight: Combined with cancellation and delay cards, the bar chart highlights better-performing airlines***

4. Scatterplot: Arrival vs Departure Delays

- *Shows that departure delays are directly proportional to arrival delays*

***Insight: Useful for customers to anticipate arrival delays based on departure performance***

5. Treemap: Flights by Weekday

- *Highlights peak flight days: Monday and Friday*

***Insight: Can guide customers on busier travel days and optimize planning***

## Key Takeaways

1. Visualizations help compare airlines across multiple performance metrics
2. Dashboards provide actionable insights for customers and operational analysis
3. Combining multiple charts offers a clear view of airline efficiency, peak days, and service reliability
