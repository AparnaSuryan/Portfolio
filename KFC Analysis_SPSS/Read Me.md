# KFC Customer Cluster Analysis (SPSS)

Segmenting customers based on survey responses to understand preferences and buying patterns using SPSS Two-Step Cluster Analysis.

## Overview

This project performs a cluster analysis on KFC customer survey data to group customers with similar buying behaviors. Using SPSS, customers were segmented based on demographics, visit frequency, food preferences, and satisfaction metrics to uncover actionable insights for marketing and service strategies.

## Key Skills & Tools

- SPSS: Two-Step Cluster Analysis, Dimension Reduction, Scatter Plots
- Data Analysis: Identifying patterns, segmenting customers, validating clustering models
- Business Insights: Customer profiling, targeted marketing, and service improvement

## Methodology

1. Dimension Reduction: Reduced survey variables to two principal axes for clustering
2. Clustering: Applied Two-Step Cluster Analysis to classify customers into 3 distinct groups
3. Cluster Validation: Evaluated cluster quality and mapped results using scatter plots

## Cluster Profiles
